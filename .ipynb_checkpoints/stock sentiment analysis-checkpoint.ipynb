    "Developed a machine learning model for stock sentiment analysis using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BOW (Bag-of-Words) techniques. Utilized three different ML models, namely Random Forest Classifier, MultinomialNB, and Passive Aggressive Classifier, to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. The goal was to provide investors and traders with an automated tool to assess sentiment towards stocks, aiding in predicting their potential performance in the market."
